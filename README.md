# capstoneTorture
Out of the millions that seek out asylum in the United States, thousands are victims of torture. These are a few of them.

For the function of calculating a distance between lat and long, I found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2637023/how-to-calculate-the-latlng-of-a-point-a-certain-distance-away-from-another

In order to use this, you have to navigate thorugh Google maps functions. Here is the website: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/intro#RequestParameters

There's quite a few steps we have to do to get just the map ready, I don't know if we need to download the map code, I just want to make sure we can utilize Google Maps. I've created an API Key for the distance calculator below:

STRING MATCH (I assume we'll need to put the zip codes in a string?):

This could be a reference on how to read and write the zip code csv file:

NOAH-
Here’s the step by step info/process on getting asylum in the U.S. under the UN Convention Against Torture. But first I’ve listed a few things that I think should be the main takeaways, part of the context and lead-in we give for the piece—there are a couple questionable/fucked up things that we should emphasize before showing the step by step process:

There is no formal way to apply specifically for asylum under the UN Convention Against Torture—you apply like all other asylum seekers, in the same pool. This means you are funneled into the big queue, which is years long.

The most important part of the process—the in-person interview—can take more than two years to schedule. The CIS has a chart showing this delay - if you applied to the Arlington, VA office in September 2013, for example, you got an appointment in January 2016.

Because you’re lumped in with other asylum seekers, you’re not allowed to work during this time. (We should explore this—are there asylum/torture seekers who are forced to work illegally in order to get by during those two or three years? I bet there are.)

There are only eight of these offices nationwide to handle asylum claims (torture and all others, which is again why torture asylum seekers’ claims get bogged down).

There are actually downsides to applying as a torture victim: you can be removed to a third country, the Convention Against Torture protection isn’t permanent and could be terminated by Homeland Security, and even if you get protection you aren’t eligible to apply for a green card and your family isn’t protected—but none of those things can be imposed on a regular, non-torture asylum seeker.

The Step By Step to Getting Asylum Under UN Convention Against Torture

— Arrive in the U.S. 

— If you don’t have the right documents, you can be detained and can apply for asylum “Defensively.” This will bring your case to the Dept. of Justice Executive office for Immigration Review.

— If you enter the country, you have one year to fill out the I-589 form. Check the box that says you’re applying under UN CAT, and submit documents that prove you have been tortured.

— Send I-589 to an office in Lincoln, Nebraska. This is called applying “Affirmatively.”

—Wait an indefinite amount of time. You will eventually receive a notice to appear for fingerprinting.

—Go to a USCIS field office to get your fingerprints taken—there are sometimes three in a state, sometimes just one.

—Wait up to three years for notice of a scheduled interview. 

—Your interview will be at one of only eight locations around the country, and will last just one hour. (For example, applicants in Idaho will be sent to Chicago.)

— Torture victims’ applications will then be sent to Immigration Court, where an immigration judge will issue the final decision.

—Receive your decision: Denial, Deferral of Removal, or Withholding of Removal.**


**Both deferral of removal and withholding of removal allow you to be sent to a third party country against your will. Neither are permanent, and your case can be opened up again by an immigration judge if conditions in your home country change.
