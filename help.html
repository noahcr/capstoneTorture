<!-- Alright - So here's where I'm curious what to search:
	There are eight locations within the U.S. that conduct interviews for amnesty. On the CIR website, it shows exactly which location your interview will be at based on which state you're in. 

	We have a list of zip codes that we are putting into eight separate CSV files (one file for each location and their corresponding zip codes).

	The point is to have a user put in their zip code, the system finds that zip code within one of the eight CSV files, and if it's in that file, it displays the location's latitute and longitude on a google map, calculates the distance between the user's zip code and the interview location and displays the average wait time for that one location. 

FOR POPULATING WAIT TIME & CLOSEST LOCATION
	So, below is the current HTML skeleton:
	I have an input and a button-->
<input id="zipCode" type="number">Type in Zip Code</input>

<button id="calc">Calculate</button>
<!-- Below the calculate button I have three div id's -->
	<div id="closestLocation"></div>
	<div id="waitTime"></div>
	<div id="map"></div>
<!-- Below is the java I've come up with, I think the best option is the endsWith function, but from what I understand that deals more with string names?-->

 <script>
 	// What I figure to do is something like this:

 var locationOneZip = [11206,11415,11001]; // all the zip codes for this location would be listed in here
 var locationOneName = "Center for Immigration New Hampshire"; 
 var locationOneWait = "2.5 years till next interview";
 var zip = parsFloat(zipCode);

function populatehtml(locOperation){
   	document.getElementById('zipCode')
   		if endsWith('locationOneZip';
 		return document.getElementById('closestLocation').innerText += locationOneName;
  	// need function that returns w/ location user should go to based on locationOneZip
}
 
 function populatehtml(waitOperation){
   	document.getElementById('zipCode')
   		if endsWith('stringOne')
		return document.getElementById('waitTime').innerText += locationOneWait;
	// need function that retrns w/ wait time based on locationOneZip
}

document.getElementById('calc').onclick = function(){ populatehtml(operation);
}
 </script>
